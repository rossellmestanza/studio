## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark brown (#4A3A2A), similar to the background of the original image, evoking a sense of warmth and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light tan (#F2E8D0), complementing the dark brown and creating a balanced contrast.
- Accent color: Rust orange (#C06014) for calls to action and highlights, providing a warm and inviting feel.
- Headline font: The image shows what seems to be a form of script, which Google Fonts does not currently offer. A handwritten script-style will be used in place of that if acceptable.
- Body Font: 'PT Sans' for body text, as 'PT Sans' is compatible for font pairing with a script typeface. 
- Use food-related icons that match the menu categories, with a simple and clean design.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on showcasing high-quality images of the food.
