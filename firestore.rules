/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Fly Menú Digital.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Only the authenticated user
 * can read or write their own profile data. It also introduces a simple role-based access control.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the
 * Firebase Auth UID of the user. Each user document has a `role` field ('user' or 'admin').
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Only authenticated users can access their own data. Admins can read any user data.
 * - Data consistency between the path (`userId`) and the document's `id` field is enforced.
 * - Users can only create their own profile with the 'user' role.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `id` field within the `/users/{userId}` document is used to ensure that the document's
 * internal representation of the user ID matches the ID in the path. This allows for simple
 * and efficient authorization checks without requiring additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User data is segregated into the `/users/{userId}` collection to ensure a consistent security
 * posture for all user profiles. This simplifies rule definition and reduces the risk of unintended
 * data exposure.
